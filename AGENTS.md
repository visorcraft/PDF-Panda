# AGENTS.md — PDF Panda

## Agent Working Style

- Be concise. No long explanations. Don't restate the plan unless it changed.
- Never scan `node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, `build`, log/archive dirs, or generated files.
- Cap output when searching or reading files. Default to limits, e.g.:
  - `head -n 100` / `tail -n 100`
  - `grep -n "pattern" file | head`
  - `find . -type f | head -n 200`
  - `python script.py --limit 50`

## What this is

A cross-platform desktop PDF editor named PDF Panda (MVP). Tauri 2 backend (Rust) + React/
TypeScript frontend. Page management, viewing, annotation, Markdown conversion,
and optimized export. GPL v3. Remote: `visorcraft/PDF-Panda`. Current tag:
`v0.2.0`.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Rust (edition 2021), Tauri 2.x
- **Frontend:** Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 6 — the entire UI is one file,
  `src/App.tsx`
- **PDF rendering:** `pdfium-render` (needs a real PDFium lib — see below)
- **PDF structure edits:** `lopdf`
- **Build accel:** `mold` (Linux-only linker), `sccache` (both required locally;
  configured in `.cargo/config.toml`)

## CRITICAL: PDFium library

Rendering needs a **standard PDFium build** (the C `FPDF_*` API).

- The system `libdeepin-pdfium` is a **different, incompatible C++ API** (exports
  no `FPDF_*` symbols). Never bind to it.
- **Fetch the prebuilt lib before rendering:** `scripts/fetch-pdfium.sh`
  → installs into `src-tauri/vendor/pdfium/` (gitignored, not committed).
- Loader search order (`bind_pdfium` in `main.rs`): `PDFIUM_LIB_PATH` env → next
  to the executable → Tauri resource dir (packaged builds) → `src-tauri/vendor/
  pdfium/` → system library. If none is found, the render commands return an
  error string (they no longer panic/abort the app).
- Packaged builds ship it via `bundle.resources` in `tauri.conf.json`; it lands
  at `<resource_dir>/vendor/pdfium/` and is resolved during Tauri `setup`.
- The process-wide PDFium binding is protected by a `Mutex`. Keep PDFium-backed
  commands serialized unless you have evidence the loaded PDFium build is safe
  for concurrent page render/text extraction in this app.

## Build & run

**Always use the Tauri CLI, never plain `cargo`:**

- Dev: `npm run tauri dev`
- Binary only: `npx tauri build --no-bundle` → `src-tauri/target/release/pdf-panda`
- Packages: `npx tauri build` → deb/rpm/appimage (AppImage needs `appimagetool`)

⚠️ **Plain `cargo build --release` produces a DEV-MODE binary** that tries to load
the Vite dev server (`localhost:5173`) and shows "connection refused". Only the
Tauri CLI enables production asset embedding (it sets the `custom-protocol`
feature). The CI build step uses `npx tauri build --no-bundle`.

## Linux / Wayland gotcha

`main.rs` sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` on Linux at startup. WebKitGTK's
DMABUF renderer crashes with `Gdk Error 71 (Protocol error)` on some bleeding-edge
multi-GPU Wayland stacks. This keeps GPU compositing but drops zero-copy
presentation. A user-set value wins. Remove it once webkit2gtk ships a working
DMABUF renderer for the target hardware.

## Testing & quality gates (CI runs all on Linux, macOS, Windows)

Run from `src-tauri/` unless noted:

- `cargo test` — 103 unit tests for every lopdf-based command, working-copy flows,
  highlights/notes, and validation paths (no PDFium needed for the default suite).
- Ignored end-to-end smoke test (needs PDFium + a file):
  `PDF_PANDA_TEST_PDF=/path/to.pdf cargo test render_real_pdf_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture`
  This smoke test covers render → thumbnails → Markdown extraction → render
  page 2 after Markdown, which guards the Markdown-to-PDF transition path.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets` (CI sets `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`)
- `cargo fmt --check` (one `rustfmt.toml` at repo root — don't reintroduce a
  second `.rustfmt.toml`)
- `npx tsc --noEmit`

CI does **not** install PDFium — the lib is loaded at runtime only, so compilation
and the default test suite don't need it.

## Architecture

- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` — all Tauri commands, the PDFium binding, and the test
  module. Commands: `list_pdf_browser_entries`, `get_pdf_page_count`,
  `render_pdf_page`, `get_pdf_thumbnails`, `delete_page`, `move_page`,
  `rotate_page`, `split_pdf`, `insert_pdf`, `convert_pdf_to_markdown`,
  `save_pdf_markdown`, `optimize_pdf`, `pdf_is_encrypted`, `verify_pdf_password`,
  `open_working_copy_with_password`, `protect_pdf`, `add_highlight`, `remove_highlight`,
  `add_text_note`, `remove_text_note`, `add_ink_stroke`, `remove_ink_stroke`,
  `add_square`, `add_circle`, `add_line`, `remove_square`, `remove_circle`,
  `remove_line`, `list_stamp_presets`, `add_text_stamp`, `add_image_stamp`,
  `remove_text_stamp`, `remove_image_stamp`, `add_redaction`, `remove_redaction`,
  `get_image_dimensions`, `add_page_image`, `get_pdf_form_fields`, `set_pdf_form_field`,
  `add_text_form_field`, `get_annotations`, `file_byte_size`.
- `src/App.tsx` — the whole UI (toolbar, scrollable viewer, thumbnail sidebar,
  split/insert modals, highlight overlays, print surface).
- `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` — Tauri ACL (`core:default`). Custom app
  commands don't need ACL entries; plugins do.
- Page-tree edits assume a **flat page tree** (every `/Kids` entry is a leaf
  page). `/Count` is kept in sync in `set_pages_kids`.
- Annotation coords are stored in **natural (unscaled) image pixels**; the viewer
  applies zoom as a CSS transform so overlays stay aligned.

## Current status (accurate)

**Working & verified:** open (in-app path modal + built-in PDF browser, Recently Opened list,
browser starts in the last opened-file directory), close current PDF, view + zoom
(25–400%) + thumbnails, prev/next + mouse-wheel page-turn at scroll boundaries,
editable page/zoom fields, fixed (non-scrolling) toolbar, drag-reorder, delete
with page-specific confirmation, rotate, insert, split, optimize (metadata strip
+ image recompress + prune + stream compress), print (native print dialog via
`window.print()`), highlight (click-to-start → click-to-finish, persists,
click-an-existing-highlight to remove), sticky text notes (N — click to place,
click-to-remove in note mode), freehand ink drawing (D — drag to draw,
click-to-remove in draw mode), shape outlines (S — rectangle/ellipse/line,
click-to-remove in shape mode), text/image stamps (T — preset badges,
click-to-remove in stamp mode), redaction boxes (X — two-click black boxes,
click-to-remove in redact mode), page image insertion (I — path modal then
two-click placement into page content), interactive form fields (F — list/fill
existing fields, create text fields with two-click placement), PDF/Markdown view toggle with sibling
`.md` auto-save (or Save Markdown As… custom path) and overwrite confirmation,
Markdown conversion (PDFium text
extraction — decodes CID/Type0 fonts, with heuristic headings, TOC/table, and
column-table formatting). On save, exports page renders and embedded XObject
images to `<pdf-name>_assets/`. Undo/Redo skips per-edit snapshots for files
larger than 32 MB.

**Crash notes from v0.1.1 work:** native PDF file dialogs were removed after the
Open PDF dialog path froze on the target Linux/Wayland stack. Thumbnail clicks
while in Markdown view must switch back to PDF mode before rendering the target
page; the UI currently defers that render by animation frames to avoid racing
the WebKitGTK view transition.

**MVP status:** Phases 1–6 complete (`v0.2.0`). See `PLAN.md` and `README.md`.

**Known gaps / future work (post-MVP):** see `PLAN.md` **vNext roadmap**.
Signing steps: `docs/SIGNING.md`.

**Still open:**
- Markdown output is heuristic layout reconstruction from PDF text geometry; no
  OCR or tagged-PDF semantics yet. Embedded image export handles JPEG, PNG,
  DeviceGray, DeviceCMYK, Indexed, and JPXDecode filters.
- Markdown defaults to saving beside the open PDF as `<pdf-name>.md`; use Save
  Markdown As… in the Markdown view for a custom path.
- Native PDF file dialogs are intentionally avoided on the current Linux/Wayland
  target because the WebKitGTK/portal path can hang the app when opening a file.
- AppImage bundling needs `appimagetool` installed (deb/rpm work out of the box).
- Rust unit tests cover all lopdf commands and validation paths; manual release QA
  in `docs/MANUAL_E2E.md`. PDFium paths use ignored `render_real_pdf_smoke` when
  PDFium is present. Local CI parity: `scripts/smoke-test.sh`.

## Conventions

- **Commit attribution:** commits are authored by the human committer **only**.
  NEVER add AI/agent attribution anywhere: no assistant credit lines, co-author
  trailers, assistant names, model names, vendor names, or tool names in messages,
  code, or docs. Grep the staged diff for attribution markers before committing.
- Keep the **Status & Verification** section in `PLAN.md` and this file accurate
  when features change.
- Match existing style; run fmt + clippy + tsc and the test suite before claiming
  work is done. Verify behavior with evidence, not assertions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- **Attribution (IMPORTANT):** Commits are authored solely by the human committer. Never attribute code changes to any AI agent, assistant, or tool — including, but not limited to, **Cursor**, **cursoragent**, **Claude**, and **Codex**. Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By` trailers, "Generated with…" / "Assisted-by" lines, or any other AI attribution in commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, code, or comments.
